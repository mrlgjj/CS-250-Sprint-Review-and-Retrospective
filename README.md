# CS-250-Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
Sprint Review and Retrospective for project

>**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**   
• Implementing user needs is a process that requires interpreting what the user expects to receive and creating a program that delivers this. User stories is a way to document the user's needs in order to create a plan to bring them to fruition.  
>**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
• I want to use agile methodology to its fullest potential in order to achieve success in software development. I approach the development process by following a vision for creating the program. This vision can be my own, or it can be that of the end-user. The vision can formatted to me in user story form or I can create a plan myself for what this program will entail. The agile processes I will incorporate, whether I work on a team or as a freelancer are those involving sprint, backlog keeping and iteration cycles. I believe that whether working on a team or as a solopreneur, the principles are golden and the right development plan template for getting a good deliverable product to the client.   
>**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**   
• Being a good team member means being what it takes in your own role to make the vision of the product your team is tasked to create a reality. This entails owning up to your limits when they manifest and you are aware of them. It also means upholding the principles of scrum or whichever methodology your team needs to adhere to, and being an advocate for those principles, as they are the chosen template in order to complete the work necessary to deliver the best product possible.
